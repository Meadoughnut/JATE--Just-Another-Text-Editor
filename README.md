### Description

**Just Another Text Editor (JATE)** is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that allows users to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection. The app can be installed directly to the user's device, works offline, and saves content to the browser's IndexedDB for persistent storage. The project demonstrates the use of IndexedDB, service workers, and Webpack to create an offline-first PWA with data persistence.
